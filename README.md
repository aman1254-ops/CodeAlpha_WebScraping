# Weather Scraper – CodeAlpha Internship Task 1

## 📌 Introduction
This project is part of my **CodeAlpha Internship**.  
It is a simple **Web Scraping tool** made with Python that extracts **live weather data** using `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests`, and stores it in **CSV format**.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- BeautifulSoup (for HTML parsing)  
- Requests (for fetching data)  
- CSV (for storing data)

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The script (`weather_scraper.py`) fetches weather data from the web.  
2. It extracts required details like **temperature, humidity, condition, etc.**  
3. The data is then stored in a file named `weather_data.csv`.

---

## 📂 Files in Repository
- `weather_scraper.py` → Python code for scraping  
- `weather_data.csv` → Sample weather data stored in CSV  

---

## ✅ Output
The script generates a CSV file with real-time weather information in tabular format.
